          The MSS runs various student-led reading groups throughout the year.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Algebraic Geometry</strong> - Tuesdays 1:00 - 2:00 in CAB 457
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Algebraic Topology</strong> - Tuesdays 3:30 - 4:30 in CAB 415-B
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-4 text-white">
